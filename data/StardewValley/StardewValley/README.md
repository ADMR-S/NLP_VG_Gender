# Stardew Valley

## Source

The source here is the game data for in yaml format. This includes:

-  Character dialogue
-  Marriage dialogue
-  Event dialogue

There are some lines of dialogue that are not captured in the types above. For example, responses of NPCs to giving them items are not included in these files. These seem to be partly procedurally generated, e.g. Elliott being offered a flower says "Hmm, I'm not a huge fan of this". see [here](https://youtu.be/JPCBG8KDZOI?t=1079)

Television reports (such as weather report, fortune teller) are missing from the source file. Some sidequest dialogue (eg Willy fishing quest) is missing too.

The source files used to be publicly available, but now must be sourced from game data and placed into the "raw" folder. The source files are named e.g. "Abigail.yaml" or "Event_AnimalShop.yaml" or "MarriageDialogueAbigail.yaml".

## Gender coding

According to https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Dwarf:
"The Dwarf's gender in the game data is "undefined" (see Content\Data\NPCDispositions.xnb)."
